## Executive Summary

**Project Foresight** is an enterprise-grade fraud detection system that fundamentally reimagines financial security by treating fraud as a **physical energy state** rather than a statistical pattern. By combining **Graph Neural Networks (GAT)**, **Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC)**, and **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**, Foresight detects sophisticated fraud rings that evade traditional machine learning systems.

### The Problem
Traditional fraud detection systems (XGBoost, Random Forests) analyze transactions in isolation, relying on statistical features like amount, time, and location. Sophisticated fraud rings—especially **"Mule Networks"**—structure their transactions to appear statistically normal, creating a **critical blind spot** where systems assign 0% risk to genuinely fraudulent activity.

### The Solution
Project Foresight operates in **topological-quantum space**, analyzing the **structural DNA** of transaction networks rather than superficial features. By mapping fraud risk to Hamiltonian energy states, we identify malicious patterns that are **mathematically invisible** to classical AI.

### **Phase 1: Topological Encoding**
- **Technology**: Graph Attention Network (PyTorch Geometric)
- **Input**: Raw transaction graph (sender, receiver, amount, neighbors)
- **Output**: 16-dimensional topological embedding representing structural relationships
- **Innovation**: Captures hidden network DNA invisible to tabular models

### **Phase 2: Classical Screening**
- **Technology**: Quantum Support Vector Classifier (Qiskit)
- **Process**: Maps embedding to Hilbert Space via ZZ-Feature Map
- **Output**: Probabilistic suspicion score (0-100%)
- **Benefit**: Fast, high-level filtering reduces VQE computational load

### **Phase 3: Hamiltonian Biasing**
- **Physics Concept**: Symmetry breaking via external fields
- **Implementation**: Classical QSVC score biases the Hamiltonian term `+ (P_classical · Z)`
- **Rationale**: Tilts energy landscape to lower activation energy for weak fraud signals
- **Validation**: Transactions with robust topology resist the bias; fraudulent ones collapse to excited states

### **Phase 4: VQE Forecasting**
- **Technology**: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (Qiskit Algorithms)
- **Process**: Simulates transaction as physical system to find minimum energy state
- **Output**: Quantum state probabilities mapping to risk categories
- **Advantage**: Distinguishes "weird but safe" from "structurally malicious" via energy stability testing

## Scientific Foundation

### **Novel Contributions**
1. **Perturbation Vector Bridge**: First application of graph embedding deviations to quantum feature maps
2. **Fraud Hamiltonian**: Novel mapping of financial risk to Pauli operator coefficients
3. **Cascaded Hybrid Architecture**: Multi-stage screening pipeline optimized for real-time deployment

### **Research Validation**
- **Ground State Anomaly Detection**: Validated by Fraunhofer AISEC (2024) study on VQE for anomaly classification
- **Quantum Topological GNN**: Aligns with Dec 2025 research on Hamiltonian-based multi-party transaction dynamics
- **Hybrid Scalability**: Supported by Sopra Steria/HSBC (2025) pilots confirming classical preprocessing necessity

### **Technical Defense**
> *"We use Prior-Informed Quantum Search. The classical QSVC probability biases the Hamiltonian to lower activation energy for weak fraud signals. This allows detection of topologically valid but energetically subtle anomalies—patterns that are mathematically invisible to correlation-based classifiers."*
