This is the Business & Technical Defense section of your presentation. This is how you answer the "Shark Tank" questions from the judges.
1. How is this a Product for Banking?
"Project Janus is not just a model; it is a Plug-and-Play Security Layer."
Currently, banks use "Rules Engines" (If amount > $10k, flag it). This is old and rigid.
The Product: Janus acts as an API Microservice that sits behind the bank's mobile app.
The Workflow:
User clicks "Send Money."
Bank App sends transaction details to Janus API.
Janus returns a Risk Score (Safe/Critical) in milliseconds.
If Critical, the bank blocks the transfer or asks for FaceID.
2. How does it work instantly? (The Latency Defense)
Judge: "Quantum is slow. How do you do this in the 200ms transaction window?"
You: "We use an Asynchronous Architecture."
The "Heavy Lifting" is Pre-Computed: The GNN updates the Graph Embeddings continuously in the background (Async). These mathematical "fingerprints" are stored in a super-fast cache (Redis Feature Store).
The "Live Check" is Fast: When the transaction happens, we don't retrain the model. We just:
Fetch the pre-computed vectors.
Run the QSVC (which is just fast linear algebra on a simulator).
Result: A decision in < 50ms.
The VQE is Selective: We don't run the heavy VQE on every coffee purchase. We only trigger the deep VQE analysis if the initial QSVC score is suspicious (>50%). This optimizes speed vs. security.
3. Is VQE Slow? How do we tackle that?
Judge: "VQE requires thousands of 'shots' to converge. Isn't that too slow?"
You: "Yes, on current physical hardware, it is slow. We tackle this in two ways:"
Simulation for Speed: For this product stage, we run VQE on High-Performance Simulators (Qiskit Aer). Since we are looking at specific sub-graphs (2-4 qubits), the simulation is instant.
The "Hybrid Trigger": We use the VQE as a Second Opinion.
Level 1 (XGBoost/QSVC): Screens 100% of traffic. (Fast).
Level 2 (VQE): Only screens the top 1% of "Grey Area" cases where the bank would normally call the customer manually. VQE is still faster than a human analyst.
4. How does it work for a "New User"? (The Cold Start)
Judge: "I just opened an account. I have no history. Does Janus work for me?"
You: "Yes, because Janus looks at Neighbors, not just History."
Classical AI (XGBoost): Fails. It sees "History = Null" and guesses.
Project Janus (GNN + Quantum):
Even if You are new, the person you are paying is not.
If a new account immediately sends money to a known "High-Risk Node" (a Mule), the GNN sees that link instantly.
The Physics: Adding a new node that connects directly to a "Bad" node creates High Energy Frustration in the VQE Hamiltonian. The system flags you immediately based on who you know, not who you are.
5. The Ultimate Question: "Why Quantum? XGBoost is fine!"
Judge: "XGBoost works for 99% of banks. Why do we need this complexity?"
You: "XGBoost is great at Statistics, but it is blind to Topology."
"We built Janus not to replace XGBoost, but to catch the specific, sophisticated rings that XGBoost mathematically cannot see."
6. Realities & Future
The Reality Today: We are running on Simulators. It is a "Quantum-Inspired" solution running on classical GPUs. It is production-ready now as a software solution.
The Future (3-5 Years): As Quantum Hardware (QPUs) hits 100+ stable qubits, we can replace the Simulator with a real QPU. This will allow us to analyze massive fraud rings (100+ people) that are impossible to simulate classically. We are "Quantum-Ready."
Feature
XGBoost (Classical)
Project Janus (Quantum)
Data View
Rows & Columns (Spreadsheet).
Nodes & Edges (The Web).
Blind Spot
"The Hidden Ring." If a fraudster uses normal amounts ($500) and normal times, XGBoost sees nothing wrong. (See Row 1 & 2 in my logs).
Topology. Janus sees that this "Normal" $500 is part of a 5-person circular chain.
Detection Logic
"Is this amount weird?"
"Does this relationship break the stability of the network?"
The Result
Catches Credit Card Theft.
Catches Money Laundering & Mule Rings.
